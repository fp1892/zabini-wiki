<div class="card">
  <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
  <p class="kicker">
    The MVP application determines a fair and transparent MVP candidate based on historical
    performance and balancing rules.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>1. Person Representation</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Each participant is represented as a persistent entity. All historical data remains
    attached to the person until explicitly removed by an admin.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>2. Event Recording</h2>
  <p class="small">
    An event represents a single competitive session. For each event, up to ten placements
    can be recorded.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    Participants without a placement automatically receive a default value to avoid bias.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>3. MVP Cooldown Rule</h2>
  <p class="small">
    The cooldown mechanism prevents the same person from becoming MVP repeatedly in short succession.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    Cooldown is decremented only when MVP is awarded, not per event.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>4. MVP Calculation</h2>
  <p class="small">
    The MVP score is calculated using an intentionally simple formula.
    The goal is interpretability rather than mathematical optimization.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
averagePlacement = sum(placements) / numberOfPlacements

score =
  (20 - averagePlacement) * 3
  + (10 - mvpCount)
  - titlePenalty
  </code></pre>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>5. Eligibility Rules</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Blocked participants are excluded</li>
    <li>Participants on cooldown are excluded</li>
    <li>At least one recorded event is required</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>6. Administrative Actions</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Administrative actions exist to recover from mistakes or migrate data.
    They are not intended for regular usage.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>7. Expected Behavior</h2>
  <p class="small">
    The system assumes good faith usage. All rules are deterministic and produce
    the same result for all users at all times.
  </p>
</div>
