  <h2>Documentation Hub</h2>
  <p class="kicker">
    This wiki serves as the central documentation space for the Zabini MVP system.
    It is intended to provide long-term, maintainable documentation for both
    technical maintainers and application users.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    All documentation is protected by the same login mechanism as the MVP application itself.
    Access is intentionally restricted to ensure internal consistency and prevent misuse.

  <h2>MVP Code Documentation</h2>
  <p class="small">
    This section documents the complete technical implementation of the MVP system.
    It explains architectural decisions, data flow, authentication concepts, Firestore
    state management, admin functionality, undo mechanics and long-term maintenance considerations.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    This documentation is written for developers, maintainers and technically inclined administrators.
    It is intentionally verbose and explanatory rather than tutorial-style.

  <h2>MVP Application Documentation</h2>

    This section describes the functional behavior of the MVP application itself.
    It explains all available actions, buttons, workflows and rules from a user and admin perspective.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    The goal is to make the system transparent, predictable and fair for all participants.
    Every calculation and rule is documented explicitly.

  <h2>Documentation Scope</h2>

    This wiki intentionally avoids short summaries. Instead, it focuses on precise
    explanations, explicit assumptions and clear reasoning behind every system behavior.
  </p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>No undocumented side effects</li>
    <li>No hidden rules</li>
    <li>No implicit assumptions</li>
    <li>Long-term maintainability over brevity</li>
  </ul>
